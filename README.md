Angular reader is a simple Atom feed reader app that shows off some new features in [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org), and generally shows off the simplicity of building apps with Angular.

The app is a proof-of-concept, and a little rough around the edges. It should work with most Atom feeds, but may break if it has trouble parsing.

## Animation Examples
As of Angular 1.1.4, Angular provides a simple directive to declaratively manage JavaScript and CSS3 animations of other directives 

### Add Feed Form
The left column of the main view of the application provides an area to add a new feed to the reader. In this simple directive, we're using:

 * An HTML5 datalist with an ng-repeat directive to recommend feeds while typing.
 * Animating the "add feed" link and the form itself while showing/hiding, using ng-animate and ng-show.
 * Declarative form validation, using ng-pattern and ng-required.
